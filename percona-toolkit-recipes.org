#+AUTHOR: Marcos Albe, Fernando Ipar, Ryan Lowe

# Some comments and/or 'presenter notes' included. The slides are
# intentionally minimal as this will be focused on short demos for
# every recipe instead. 

* Introduction
** About us
Who we are and what we do
# I want to keep text to the minimum necessary, so let's just present
# ourselves verbally here. 
** Why should you be here?
If you manage MySQL servers, *don't* reinvent the wheel :)
# Percona toolkit provides properly tested and documented solutions to
# problems that are frequently handled by home brewed scripts instead
# (pt-archiver is a very good example). 
# Don't reinvent the wheel, find and use a proper tool instead. The
# recipes will provide a good starting point for you to build a
# solution tailored to your specific version of the problem. 
* Problems
** List of problems for review
- Making sure replication works as expected
  - Verifying replicas
  - Making them consistent again if needed
- Performance optimization
  - Identifying the best goals for our effort
  - Sistematic review of 'bad' queries
- Upgrading MySQL
  - Having the odds on our side
- Troubleshooting
  - Investigating hard to diagnose problems
- Operations
